Hello all,

Our next Open Hours is just under 4.5 hours at 7:00 PM US PST (Wednesday night in US) which is 11:00 AM Thursday morning in Beijing, China.  Please join me for discussion of the latest happenings in the world of RISC-V.

Slides to get discussion going:

RSVP on this community event page attend and it should send you to the Zoom link.  https://community.riscv.org/events/details/risc-v-international-risc-v-open-hours-presents-risc-v-open-hours-1/

However, if there is a problem, then this is the Zoom link that I have in my calendar which I believe should work:

I have the host code ahead of time so we should not have problem like in the past :)

Thanks,
Drew

通过 Zoom Webinar 形式创建的会议，需要登陆下RISC-V的社区系统提交下邮箱地址来收取链接地址。进入的时候可能需要输入邮箱地址（也可能不需要）。
